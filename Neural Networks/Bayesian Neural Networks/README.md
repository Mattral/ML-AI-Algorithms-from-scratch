# Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)

## Introduction

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) extend traditional neural networks by introducing uncertainty into their weights. Instead of having fixed weights as in standard neural networks, BNNs model weights as probability distributions, allowing for more robust uncertainty estimates.

## Neural Network Architecture

The architecture of Bayesian Neural Networks can be diverse and is not limited to a specific type. Common neural network architectures, such as feedforward neural networks (including perceptrons) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used as the basis for Bayesian Neural Networks.

## How it Works

1. **Weight Uncertainty:** In BNNs, each weight in the neural network is modeled as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian.

2. **Training:** During training, BNNs use a combination of the observed data and a prior distribution to update the weights' posterior distribution. This is often done using techniques like variational inference or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

3. **Inference:** During inference (testing or prediction), the weights' posterior distribution is used to make predictions. This naturally provides uncertainty estimates for the predictions.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

1. **Uncertainty Estimation:** BNNs provide not only point estimates but also uncertainty estimates for predictions, which is valuable in decision-making.

2. **Robustness:** BNNs can be more robust to overfitting, especially in scenarios with limited data.

### Cons

1. **Computational Cost:** The training and inference in BNNs can be computationally expensive compared to traditional neural networks.

2. **Complexity:** Implementing and understanding BNNs may require a solid understanding of Bayesian statistics.

## Real-World Uses

1. **Finance:** BNNs are applied in financial modeling to capture uncertainty in predictions.

2. **Medical Diagnostics:** BNNs are used in medical diagnostics where uncertainty in predictions is crucial for decision support.
