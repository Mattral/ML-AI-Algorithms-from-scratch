# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much of the original variability as possible. This README covers the implementation of PCA from scratch and provides insights into its workings, advantages, disadvantages, and common use cases.

## How PCA Works

1. **Standardization:**
   - Standardize the input data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.

2. **Covariance Matrix:**
   - Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix provides information about the relationships between different features.

3. **Eigendecomposition:**
   - Perform eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

4. **Sort Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**
   - Sort the eigenvalues in descending order along with their corresponding eigenvectors.

5. **Select Principal Components:**
   - Choose the top k eigenvectors, where k is the desired dimensionality of the reduced space.

6. **Projection:**
   - Project the standardized data onto the lower-dimensional subspace formed by the selected eigenvectors.

7. **Inverse Transformation (Optional):**
   - If needed, inverse transform the reduced data back to the original space.

## Advantages

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA is effective in reducing the number of features while preserving essential information.
- **Noise Reduction:** By focusing on principal components with higher eigenvalues, PCA filters out noise.
- **Visualization:** Lower-dimensional representations allow for easy visualization and interpretation of data.

## Disadvantages

- **Loss of Interpretability:** Transformed features may lose their original meaning.
- **Sensitivity to Outliers:** PCA is sensitive to outliers in the data.
- **Assumes Linearity:** PCA assumes a linear relationship between features.

## Common Use Cases

- **Data Compression:** Reduce storage requirements while maintaining key information.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify patterns and relationships in high-dimensional data.
- **Visualization:** Visualize complex datasets in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that capture the most important information.

## Implementation from Scratch

The provided Python script (`PrincipalComponentAnalysis.py`) demonstrates the step-by-step implementation of PCA without relying on external libraries. It includes a `PCA` class with methods for fitting, transforming, and inverse transforming data.
