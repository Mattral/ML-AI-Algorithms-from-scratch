## Educational Content

### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. In a labeled dataset, each input data point is associated with the corresponding correct output, allowing the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs. The goal is for the algorithm to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output labels. Instead, the algorithm discovers patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own. Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and representations through training on labeled data. Deep learning, a subset of neural networks, involves architectures with multiple layers (deep neural networks).

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.

### What is Bayesian Learning?

Bayesian learning is a statistical framework that combines prior knowledge with new evidence to update and refine our beliefs about uncertain quantities. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that focus solely on point estimates, Bayesian learning provides a probabilistic framework for reasoning about uncertainty.


## Usage

Each algorithm is provided as a standalone Python script. You can run these scripts to see the algorithms in action. Additionally, the code is extensively documented to help you understand the implementation details.
