# Supervised Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of various supervised learning algorithms built from the ground up. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed documentation to help you understand the underlying principles.

## Educational Content

### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. In a labeled dataset, each input data point is associated with the corresponding correct output, allowing the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs. The goal is for the algorithm to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output labels. Instead, the algorithm discovers patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own. Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers. Neural networks can learn complex patterns and representations through training on labeled data. Deep learning, a subset of neural networks, involves architectures with multiple layers (deep neural networks).

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.
