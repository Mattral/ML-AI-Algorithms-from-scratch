# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification and Regression

## Overview

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. This README covers both SVM classification and regression, implemented from scratch without relying on external libraries.

## Implementation

### SVM Classification and Regression from Scratch

The provided Python script (`svm_classification_regression.py`) demonstrates the implementation of SVM for both classification and regression. It uses a simple stochastic gradient descent approach for optimization.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the weights and bias terms to zero.

2. **Add Bias Term:**
   - Add a bias term to the feature matrix.

3. **Stochastic Gradient Descent:**
   - Update the weights using stochastic gradient descent with appropriate loss functions.
   - For classification, the hinge loss is used.
   - For regression, a loss function that minimizes the difference between predicted and true values is employed.

4. **Convergence:**
   - Repeat the stochastic gradient descent steps for multiple epochs until convergence.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained weights to make predictions on new data.

## Advantages

- **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces:** SVM performs well in high-dimensional feature spaces, making it suitable for complex datasets.
- **Versatility:** SVM can be adapted for various tasks, including classification and regression.

## Disadvantages

- **Computational Intensity:** Training an SVM can be computationally expensive, especially on large datasets.
- **Sensitivity to Outliers:** SVM is sensitive to outliers, and their presence can impact the model's performance.

## Common Use Cases

- **Classification:** SVM is commonly used in image recognition, text classification, and spam detection.
- **Regression:** Predicting numerical values, such as house prices in real estate.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers in a dataset.
