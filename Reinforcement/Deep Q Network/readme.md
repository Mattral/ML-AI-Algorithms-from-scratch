# Simple DQN Agent

## What is it?

The Simple DQN (Deep Q Network) Agent is a reinforcement learning algorithm implemented in Python. It utilizes a Q-learning approach to train an agent to navigate a grid world environment.

## How it works

The agent employs a deep neural network to approximate the Q-values for different state-action pairs. It uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during training. The training involves experience replay, where past experiences are stored and randomly sampled for training the neural network.

## Math

The core mathematical concept behind the Simple DQN Agent is the Q-learning algorithm. The Q-values are updated using the Bellman equation, which models the expected future rewards for each action in a given state. The neural network is trained to minimize the difference between predicted Q-values and target Q-values computed using the Bellman equation.

## Uses

The Simple DQN Agent can be used for various applications, including:

- Autonomous navigation of agents in grid-like environments.
- Learning optimal strategies for sequential decision-making tasks.
- Training agents in scenarios where a reward signal guides the learning process.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- Capable of learning complex decision-making policies.
- Can handle high-dimensional state spaces.
- Suitable for environments with discrete action spaces.

### Cons

- Prone to overestimation bias.
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.
- Training may be computationally intensive for large-scale environments.
