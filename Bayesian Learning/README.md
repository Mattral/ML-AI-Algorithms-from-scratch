# Bayesian Learning

This repository contains implementations of various Bayesian learning algorithms. Each folder corresponds to a specific Bayesian learning algorithm.

## Folders

1. **Bayesian Networks**
   - Implementation of Bayesian Networks, a graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships among a set of variables.

2. **Bayesian Neural Networks**
   - Implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks, a type of neural network that introduces uncertainty in its weights.

3. **BayesianInference**
   - Implementation of Bayesian Inference, a general framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence.

4. **BayesianLinearRegression**
   - Implementation of Bayesian Linear Regression, a probabilistic approach to linear regression that models uncertainty in the regression coefficients.

5. **Gibbs Sampling**
   - Implementation of Gibbs Sampling, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions.

6. **Metropolis Hastings Algorithm**
   - Implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, a general MCMC method for sampling from a probability distribution.

7. **Variational Inference**
   - Implementation of Variational Inference, a technique for approximating complex posterior distributions.

## Usage

Each folder contains its own set of scripts and documentation. Refer to the specific folders for detailed usage and examples.
