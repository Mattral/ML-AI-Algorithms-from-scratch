# Bayesian Network Algorithm

## Overview

The Bayesian Network Algorithm is an implementation of a Bayesian Network, a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies through a directed acyclic graph.

## How it Works

The Bayesian Network Algorithm includes functionalities for:

- Initializing the network with nodes and edges.
- Visualizing the network graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
- Performing Bayesian inference using a basic conditional probability placeholder.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- Simple implementation for basic Bayesian Network understanding.
- Easy visualization of the network structure.

### Cons

- Placeholder conditional probability function; replace with a meaningful implementation for real-world applications.

## Real-life Uses

- **Medical Diagnosis:** Bayesian Networks are used in healthcare for disease diagnosis and decision support systems.
- **Fraud Detection:** In finance, Bayesian Networks help detect fraudulent activities in transactions.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Used in language models and information retrieval systems.
